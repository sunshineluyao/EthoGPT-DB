# EthoGPT-DB

## Overview

The `ChatGPT` folder contains datasets that compare cultural indices derived from survey data with those generated by ChatGPT. These datasets are used to analyze the alignment and differences between human survey responses and AI-generated responses across various cultural dimensions.

### Files

- **ChatGPT_Comparatives.csv**: Contains comparative data for traditional vs. secular and survival vs. self-expression values for different countries. It includes both survey data and ChatGPT's responses, along with calculated differences.

- **ChatGPT_Comparatives_Region.csv**: Provides aggregated error metrics (MSE and MAE) for cultural values across different regions, helping to understand regional variations in the data.

- **ChatGPT_Cultural_Indices_Global.csv**: Lists descriptors with their traditional and survival values, including transformed values for cultural dimensions.

- **ChatGPT_Indices_SelectiveCountries.csv**: Offers cultural indices for selected countries, showing both raw and transformed values for traditional vs. secular and survival vs. self-expression dimensions.

These datasets are crucial for understanding how AI models like ChatGPT perceive and replicate cultural values, and they provide insights into the potential biases and alignments in AI-generated content.
